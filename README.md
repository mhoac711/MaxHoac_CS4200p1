# MaxHoac_CS4200p1
This is a program that utilizes the misplaced tile and sum of distances heuristics to solve a 8-puzzle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to use the code:
1. Open the src folder in a designated java IDE 
2. Run the EightPuzzle.java file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What to expect:
1. The code will prompt the user for a decision on what type of puzzle they would like to be solved (random or user input)
2. The generated puzzle will be solved using both the misplaced tiles algorithm (h1) and the sum of distances from goal algorithm (h2)
3. If the puzzle is solvable, the resulting search cost and total time taken from both algorithms will be returned along with the depth and total cases.
